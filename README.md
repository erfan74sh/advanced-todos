# Advanced ToDo App

This is a bit more advanced **[ToDo application](https://advanced-todos-eshafiee.vercel.app/)** than other typical mini-projects that I built for learning purposes.

These are a few of the features I implemented in this project:

- _Drag and Drop_ cards to reorder or change cards group.
- _Three groups of cards_ for each task status like "Todo", "Doing" and "Done" .
- Assign some preset _tags_ to each card while creating your own _tags_.
- _Search_ through titles of cards and highlighting searched characters.
- _Sort_ cards based on Date and Name ascending or descending.
- ...

The most challenging part for me was "Drag and Drop" feature , which I tried to implement without using third-party libraries. I also implemented features such as closing Modals or Dropdown lists when clicked outside, in the meantime I learned more and deeper features of React such as `custom hooks`, `useReducers`, `useContext`, `useRef` and .... .
